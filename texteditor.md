here are some shortcuts to use
linux concepts and shortcuts:
When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times. You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want.

If you run the command cd without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home directory.

pwd
Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.

ls
List the contents of a directory.

cd
Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.

Relative path
A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

Absolute path
A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

In the previous section we learnt about something called Tab Completion. If you use that before encountering the space in the directory name then the terminal will automatically escape any spaces in the name for you.

file
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

ls -a
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

Everything is a file under Linux
Even directories.

Linux is an extensionless system
Files can have any extension they like or none at all.

Linux is case sensitive
Beware of silly typos.
