# Component-Based Architecture
1. **What is a *component*?**
>A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

2.  **What are the *characteristics* of a component?**
 - **Reusability** − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- **Replaceable**− Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- **Not context specific** − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- **Extensible** − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- **Encapsulated** − A A component  depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- **Independent** − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

3. **What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**

- Ease of deployment 

- Reduced cost since you are using a third party component

- Ease of development 

- Reusable which helps with cost

- A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

- The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

- Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

- Independency and flexible connectivity of components. 




# What is Props and How to Use it in React

1. **What is *props* short for?**
- Props is short for properties in React.


2. **How are props used in React?**
- Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
- Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props.
- Finally, render the Props Data.


3. **What is the flow of props?**
> Data flow one way from parent to child.

## Things I want to know more about:

- I would like to know more about the advantages of using component-based architecture
- I would like to also know more about conducting component level design.
