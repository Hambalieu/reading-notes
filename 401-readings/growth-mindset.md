# The Growth Mindset

## Bias Self-Assessment

- I scored a 94 on the Self Assessment and during the time I was taking the test I realize that I still have things I need to work on to be a better person overall.During the assessment I realize that  I spent too much time on work or trying to get the work done and don't prioritize self care .Now I know to  prioritize my self care because I know this improves my overall performance as well as my ability to  mitigate bias.<br></br>

## Power of Believing

### The power of Not Yet

- The power of **NOT YET** during a study it was founded out that when students were grading not yet if they didnt pass a course it helps the student my giving them path to the future and you will understand that you are on a learning curve.From a study  Scientists measured the electrical activity from the brain as students confronted an error. On the left, you see the fixed-mindset students. There's hardly any activity. They run from the error. They don't engage with it. But on the right, you have the students with the growth mindset, the idea that abilities can be developed. They engage deeply. Their brain is on fire with yet. They engage deeply. They process the error. They learn from it and they correct it.
<br></br>

- Things we can do is praise the process that we engage in or praise the effort and strategies or focus or perseverance or even improvement with this process we got more effort, more strategies, more engagement over longer periods of time, and more perseverance when they hit really, really hard problems.
<br></br>

- In our country, there are groups of students who chronically underperform, for example, children in inner cities, or children on Native American reservations. And they've done so poorly for so long that many people think it's inevitable. But when educators create growth mindset classrooms steeped in yet, equality happens
