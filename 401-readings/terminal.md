# The Command Line

## Wahat is a Command line or Terminal ?

- A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

- The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.

## What is a Shell?

- Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you

- There are various shells available but the most common one is called **bash** which stands for Bourne again shell.

## SHORTCUTS 

- When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times. You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want.

- If you run the command cd without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home directory.

- When you start typing a path (anywhere on the command line, you're not just limited to certain commands) you may hit the Tab key on your keyboard at any time which will invoke an auto complete action. If nothing happens then that means there are several possibilities. If you hit Tab again it will show you those possibilities. You may then continue typing and hit Tab again and it will again try to auto complete for you.

- **pwd**
Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
- **ls**
List the contents of a directory.
- **cd**
Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.

## Important concepts

- **Relative path**
A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

- **Absolute path**
 A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

- **file**
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

- **ls -a**
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

- *Everything is a file under Linux*
Even directories.
- *Linux is an extensionless system*
Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
- *Linux is case sensitive*
Beware of silly typos.
