# OO Design
### Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
- is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,[1] replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.
- WET (Write everything twice)is the violation of DRY 
- AHA stands for "avoid hasty abstractions".

### Rule of three (computer programming)
- Rule of three ("Three strikes and you refactor") is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when similar pieces of code should be refactored to avoid duplication.
- It states that two instances of similar code do not require refactoring, but when similar code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure.
- **Duplication** is considered a bad practice in programming because it makes the code harder to maintain.

### You aren't gonna need it
- "You aren't gonna need it"(YAGNI) is a principle which arose from extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary
- **YAGNI** is a principle behind the XP practice of "do the simplest thing that could possibly work.
- It is meant to be used in combination with several other practices, such as continuous **refactoring**, continuous automated **unit testing**, and continuous **integration**.


### Minimum viable product
- A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.
- Be able to test a product hypothesis with minimal resources
- Reduce wasted engineering hours
- Get the product to early customers as soon as possible
- Base for other products
- Accelerate learning
- Brand building very quickly
- Testing is the essence of minimum viable products.
