1. **Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?**
- Render Happens first.


2. **What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?**
- An instance of a component is created in the constructor

3. **Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates**

- constructor,  render, React updates, componentDidMount.

4. **What does componentDidMount do?**
- This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here


## React State Vs Props


- **What types of things can you pass in the props?**
  - props can pass data of all types


- **What is the big difference between props and state?**
  - props are passed into a component as arguements, whilst state is handled inside the component; props must be updated outside of the component, state can be updated within the component.


- **When do we re-render our application?**
  - We re-render our application when changes have been copied from the virtual DOM to the acutal DOM


- **What are some examples of things that we could store in state?**
  - Examples include form inputs, data changes, or dynamic functionalities
