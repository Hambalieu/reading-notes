## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:<br></br>

| SQL | NoSQL |
| ------------ | ------------   |
|SQL databases are table based databases     |  NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores     |
| SQL databases have predefined schema   |   NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data    |
|SQL databases are vertically scalable     |SQL databases are vertically scalable       |
|SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful.     | NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents.      |
|SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases     | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database      |
<br></br>

1. # What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
- SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment.
<br></br>

2. # Give a real world example.
- SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL
<br></br>

3. # What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
- NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data)
<br></br>

4. # Give a real world example.
- Hbase is an example for this purpose.<br></br>

5. # Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
- NoSQL sinces it follows a key -value pair way of storing  <br></br>

6. # Which type of database is best for scalability?
- NoSQL is better but there is limits to it. <br></br>

7. # What does SQL stand for?
- Structured Query Language.<br></br>

8. # What is a relational database?
- Its a database which works with certain assumptions and it supports structured query language.<br></br>

9. # What type of structure does a relational database work with?
- it works with **tables**.The table is a data storage container.<br></br>

10. # What is a ‘schema’?
- Schema is the strict requirements we have for the data we store in our table.All records have to adhere to the schema<br></br>

11. # What is a NoSQL database?
- NoSQL databases are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables. They are non relational database.<br></br>

12. # How does it work?
- For NoSQL we also have *Database* and in the database we have *collections* which have *Documents* which dont have to use the same schema.which can lead to be flexible with your data.<br></br>
13. # What is inside of a Mongo database?
- MongoDB stores data records as documents which are gathered together in collections

14. # Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
- MongoDB is more flexible since you have have to use the same schema for your documents.<br></br>

15. # What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
- One of the disadvantages is you can have some duplicate data
- If the product name changes you have to update it not only in the products collections but also in the others collections.<br></br>
