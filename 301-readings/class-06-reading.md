## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
 


 1. ## What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
 - Greater efficiency. easier to catch errors on a code.
 - Engaged Collaboration. When developers pair program, they rely more on each other and can often find a solution together without needing to ask for additional help.
 - Learning from each other.
 - Pair Programming helps to improve social skills.
 - Job Interview readiness.Certain companies interview process involves pair programming between employee and applicant.
 - Work environment readiness.


 2. ## In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
 - I found the learning from each other the most beneficial .


 3. ## How does pair programming work?
 - While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the **Driver** and the **Navigator**. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
