# Growth Mindset
## My own thoughts on Growth Minset
### Dont underestimate the power of the human brain
In my own opinion growth mindset should be part of our way of thinking on a **daily** .We as humans should try to learn everyday on our daily experiences.Thinking of ways to be better ~~everday~~ as a person.
