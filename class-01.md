# 201 First Reading Assignment

## Summarry of HTML
- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled 
brackets) to give the information they surround special 
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes 
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes 
the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more 
about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are 
available for you to use, what they do, and where they 
can go.


 ### > DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
 
1. You can add comments to your code between the 
<!-- and --> markers.
2. The id and class attributes allow you to identify 
particular elements.
3. The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group 
block-level and inline elements together.
4. <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through 
which other pages can be displayed.
5. The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of 
information about your web page.
6. Escape characters are used to include special 
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©

## Process and design 

- It's important to understand who your target audience 
is, why they would come to your site, what information 
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that 
will need to go on each page.
-Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps 
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information 
using size, color, and style. 
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify 
the information you present

- The JavaScript is added last 
and enhances the usability of 
the page or the experience of 
interacting with the site. 
Keeping it separate means 
that the page still works if the 
user cannot load or run the 
JavaScript. You can also reuse 
the code on several pages 
(making the site work faster).





## HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE 
In order to understand how you can change the content of an HTML 
page using JavaScript, you need to know how a browser interprets the 
HTML code and applies styling to it. 
1. RECEIVE A PAGE AS 
HTML CODE 
Each page on a website can be 
seen as a separate document . 
So, the web consists of many 
sites, each made up of one or 
more documents. 
2. CREATE A MODEL OF 
THE PAGE AND STORE 
IT IN MEMORY 
The model shown on the right 
hand page is a representation 
of one very basic page. Its 
structure is reminiscent of a 
family tree. At the top of the 
model is a document object, 
which represents the whole 
document. 
Beneath the document object 
each box is called a node. Each 
of these nodes is another object. 
This example features three 
types of nodes representing 
elements, text within the 
elements, and attribute. 
3. USE A RENDERING 
ENGINE TO SHOW THE 
PAGE ON SCREEN 
If there is no CSS, the rendering 
engine will apply default styles 
to HTML elements. However, 
the HTML code for this example 
links to a CSS style sheet, so the 
browser requests that file and 
displays the page accordingly. 
When the browser receives 
CSS rules, the rendering engine 
processes them and applies 
each rule to its corresponding 
elements. This is how the 
browser positions the elements 
in the correct place, with the 
right colors, fonts, and so on. 
All major browsers use a **JavaScript** interpreter to translate your 
instructions (in JavaScript) into instructions the computer can follow. 
When you use JavaScript in 
the browser, there is a part of 
the browser that is called an 
interpreter (or scripting engine).
